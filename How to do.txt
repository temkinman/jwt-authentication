"token": {
    "key": "TWVtb3J5Q3J5cHQ=",
    "issuer": "MemorycryptAuthServer",
    "audience": "PostmanClient",
    "subject": "authToken"
  }

Here, the key field contains the secret key using which we will encode our tokens. You can provide any Base64 encoded string as your key.

The issuer, audience, and subject fields are used by JWT token creation logic, and embedded in every token that is generated.
